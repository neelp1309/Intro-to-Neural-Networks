Intro To Neural Network

This project explores two different applications of machine learning and neural networks:

Part A: Predicting signal quality using measurable signal parameters.

Part B: Recognizing digits in real-world images from the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset.

ðŸ§  Project Structure
Part A: Signal Quality Classification
Objective: Predict the signal quality based on input parameters.

Data: Structured tabular data with features representing signal characteristics.

Approach:

Data preprocessing and missing value handling

Feature scaling and transformation

Model building using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with TensorFlow/Keras

Evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

Part B: Street View Digit Recognition (SVHN)
Objective: Build a digit classifier using the SVHN dataset.

Data: Image data (32x32 RGB) of digits captured from Google Street View.

Approach:

Data loading using h5py files

Image normalization and label encoding

Construction of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Model training and performance analysis
